# Privacy Policy for AI Summarizer Chrome Extension

**Effective Date:** April 2, 2025

Thank you for using AI Summarizer ("the Extension"), provided by [Your Name or Company Name, if applicable]. This Privacy Policy explains how the Extension collects, uses, and discloses information when you use it. Your privacy is important to us.

## 1. Information We Process

The AI Summarizer extension processes information solely to provide its core functionality: summarizing web content using a third-party AI service selected by you. We process the following types of information **only upon your explicit action** (clicking the extension icon):

*   **Web Page Content:** When you activate the Extension on a webpage, it accesses the text content and basic structure (potentially including the URL) of that specific, currently active page. This includes content from articles, YouTube video transcripts, Hacker News threads, Amazon product details, and LeetCode problem descriptions, depending on the site you are on.
*   **User Preferences:** We store your chosen AI service provider (e.g., Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek) using Chrome's `storage.sync` feature. This allows the Extension to remember your preference across browser sessions.

We **do not** collect or store personal information like your name, email address, browsing history (beyond the single page processed upon activation), or IP address through the Extension itself. We do not use cookies or tracking technologies for our own purposes within the Extension.

## 2. How We Use Information

The information processed is used exclusively for the following purposes:

*   **To Extract Content:** The page content is accessed locally within your browser to extract the relevant text for summarization.
*   **To Facilitate Summarization:** The extracted text content is prepared and then sent **directly** to the third-party AI service you have selected in the Extension's options. This happens by opening the respective AI service's website in a new browser tab and automatically inputting the extracted text into their interface.
*   **To Store Preferences:** Your selected AI provider choice is stored locally using `chrome.storage.sync` so the Extension knows which AI service URL to open.

**The AI Summarizer Extension itself does not store the web page content you summarize or the summaries generated by the AI services on any servers we control.**

## 3. Information Sharing and Third Parties

The core function of the Extension involves sending the extracted web page content to a third-party AI service **chosen by you**.

*   When you activate the Extension, the extracted text content from the current webpage is sent **only** to the AI service you have configured in the Extension's options.
*   The current supported third-party AI services are:
    *   **Claude** (Anthropic): [https://www.anthropic.com/privacy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy)
    *   **ChatGPT** (OpenAI): [https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy)
    *   **Gemini** (Google): [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
    *   **DeepSeek**: [https://chat.deepseek.com/privacy](https://chat.deepseek.com/privacy) *(Note: Verify this is the correct, official privacy policy link for the service used)*
*   Your interaction with these third-party AI services, including the content you submit and the summaries generated, is governed by **their respective privacy policies and terms of service**. We strongly encourage you to review the privacy policy of the AI service you choose to use.
*   We do **not** share your information with any other third parties, except as required by law.

## 4. Data Storage and Security

*   **Page Content & Summaries:** As stated above, the Extension does not store the web page content you process or the resulting summaries. This data exists transiently during the extraction and submission process within your browser and is then handled by the third-party AI service you select according to their policies.
*   **User Preferences:** Your AI provider preference is stored using Chrome's `storage.sync` API. This data is associated with your Google account if you have Chrome sync enabled and is handled according to Google's privacy practices for synced storage.
*   **Security:** We implement reasonable technical measures within the Extension's code to protect the processing of information within your browser. However, please be aware that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. Your interaction with the third-party AI sites is outside the direct control of this Extension.

## 5. User Choices and Control

*   You have control over which AI service provider is used by selecting it in the Extension's options page.
*   You choose when to activate the Extension by clicking its icon on a specific webpage.
*   You can uninstall the Extension at any time through Chrome's extension management page (`chrome://extensions/`). Uninstalling will remove the stored AI preference from your local browser storage (though it might remain in your Google account sync data if enabled, managed via Google's settings).

## 6. Children's Privacy

The AI Summarizer Extension is not directed towards children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age of digital consent in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy and potentially through other means (e.g., a notice within the Extension or on its Chrome Web Store listing) if required by applicable law. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
