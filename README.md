AI Summarizer helps you quickly understand web content by leveraging powerful AI models.

**Features:**

*   **One-Click Summaries:** Simply click the extension icon on a supported page.
*   **Wide Site Compatibility:** Works on general web articles, YouTube videos (using transcripts), Hacker News comment threads, Amazon product pages, and LeetCode problem descriptions.
*   **Choose Your AI:** Select your preferred AI provider from Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, or DeepSeek in the options page.
*   **Seamless Integration:** Automatically extracts relevant content and opens your chosen AI service in a new tab with the content ready for summarization.

**How to Use:**

1.  Navigate to a webpage you want to summarize (e.g., news article, YouTube video).
2.  Click the AI Summarizer icon in your Chrome toolbar.
3.  A new tab will open with your selected AI provider, pre-filled with the page content, ready to generate a summary.
4.  Configure your preferred AI provider via the extension's options page (Right-click extension icon -> Options).

This extension utilizes Readability.js for article text extraction and custom parsers for specific sites like YouTube. It requires access to the page content upon clicking the icon and permission to open and interact with the tabs of the supported AI services. Your content is sent directly to the AI provider you select; this extension does not store your summarized content.
